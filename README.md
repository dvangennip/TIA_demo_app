# README for TIA demo

## Description
**TBD what is it**

This demo was part of a small project into the use of tangible objects in a collaborative virtual reality space. It was developed to be run in the [UTS Data Arena][1], a large-scale (10m) 360º display.

**TBD link to some video evidence later on?**

## Credits
The project was funded by a UTS Data Arena Research Exhibit Grant 2017 for the creation and implementation of a tangible user interface in the UTS Data Arena (a 360-degree screen). This grant was awarded to Elise van den Hoven and Roberto Martinez-Maldonado.
