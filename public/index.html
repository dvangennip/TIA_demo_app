			<h2>Log for 2046, March, Friday</h2>
			<p>It's my tenth day out here in the desert, I miss the comfort of home and the absence of sand.</p>
			<p>But I can't go back now, I'm still tracking the ship. It looks so serene as it floats over the landscape!</p>
			<p>I caught a brief glimpse of its occupants this morning, green creatures with a scaley hairdo, wearing some kind of toga. I don't think they liked the desert either, after a look around they hurried back inside.</p>
			<p>I hope to see more of them. I'll keep going tomorrow.</p>

			<h2>Log for 2046, April, Monday</h2>
			<p>I washed my clothes near the lake, unaware the spaceship had landed nearby.</p>
			<p>We didn't see each other until they had gotten very close to the waterline and to me!</p>
			<p>Oh! The aliens are as spooked as I am, and now they're rapidly hopping back to their ship, about to fly off! Shall I run after them and stop my notes? The ship glows blue as it hovers uneasily above the lake and it moves towards me and is going faster while I'm still writing this and now trying to move aside but the ship gets closer and lower now and I think it's going to crash so I need to drop this and run if I don't want it to hit me very s...</p>
