			<h2>Once upon a time...</h2>
			<p>A little mermaid lived in the forest among the animals. These animals were deeply displeased because the fishy appearance of the mermaid caused them to contemplate their own flaws as well as the privelege of living in their natural habitat.</p>
			<p>One day, the elder wolf decided this issue had to be resolved once and for all. He suggested to eat the mermaid and make the problem go away in one big bite. Many animals thought that was a good idea, indeed resolving the tension they had all felt.</p>

			<p>Some animals did not agree, the lizards least of all. <emphasis>'We have scales too,'</emphasis> spoke one gecko, <emphasis>'and we live here in peace too.'</emphasis> Many insects felt this argument was flawed because they felt no such peace as the lizards hunted them for food. The insects promised the other animals not to bite them and so the lizards' objections were ignored.</p>
			<p>The elder wolf got his way and ate happily ever after.</p>
